Hello will you come with me?

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
against the evils around me,
that haunt me day and night.

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
with the evils within me
which haunt others day and night.

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
with the desires within me
which will cause suffering for a lifetime.
