Hello will you come with me? and Nature Nature

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
against the evils around me,
that haunt me day and night.

Hello will you come with me,
I'm going for a fight
with the evils within me
which haunt others day and night.

but is there a nature? she was having doubt.

My mom says from doorways
before you go to bed please pray
and also sweep your room
and brush your teeth for a healthy next day
